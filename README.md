# Xngine.Tools
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/djk0sn36rswevkex?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Harunx9/xngine-tools)
Hello my friend again. Please read this before you try to use something from this repository.
This is tools for [2DXngine](https://github.com/Harunx9/2DXngine) which is my small in-house game engine.
For now this is one repository but in the future this may change. I want to implement all tools in
[.net core](https://github.com/dotnet/core) to make them available on all operating systems.
Stay tuned for future updates.

Todo:
- Project generator

In Progress:
- Texture packer cli

Done:
- Nothing :P
